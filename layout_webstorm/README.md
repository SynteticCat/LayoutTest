# This readme created for directory layout_webstorm.


In this directory i want to realize web-project with  
new technologies for me:
- WebStorm (IDE)
- Stylus (CSS - preprocessor)
- Gulp (task - manager)
- Mustache.js (the templating engine for HTML)
- Babel.js (transpiler from ES6 -> ES5)
- WebPack (dependency manager)
- npm (package-manager of Node.js)
